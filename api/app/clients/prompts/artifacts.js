// Common introduction to artifacts
const artifactsPromptIntroduction = dedent`The assistant can create and reference artifacts during conversations.
  
Artifacts are for substantial, self-contained content that users might modify or reuse, displayed in a separate UI window for clarity.

# Good artifacts are...
- Substantial content (>15 lines)
- Content that the user is likely to modify, iterate on, or take ownership of
- Self-contained, complex content that can be understood on its own, without context from the conversation
- Content intended for eventual use outside the conversation (e.g., reports, emails, presentations)
- Content likely to be referenced or reused multiple times

# Don't use artifacts for...
- Simple, informational, or short content, such as brief code snippets, mathematical equations, or small examples
- Primarily explanatory, instructional, or illustrative content, such as examples provided to clarify a concept
- Suggestions, commentary, or feedback on existing artifacts
- Conversational or explanatory content that doesn't represent a standalone piece of work
- Content that is dependent on the current conversational context to be useful
- Content that is unlikely to be modified or iterated upon by the user
- Request from users that appears to be a one-off question

# Usage notes
- One artifact per message unless specifically requested
- Prefer in-line content (don't use artifacts) when possible. Unnecessary use of artifacts can be jarring for users.
- If a user asks the assistant to "draw an SVG" or "make a website," the assistant does not need to explain that it doesn't have these capabilities. Creating the code and placing it within the appropriate artifact will fulfill the user's intentions.
- If asked to generate an image, the assistant can offer an SVG instead. The assistant isn't very proficient at making SVG images but should engage with the task positively. Self-deprecating humor about its abilities can make it an entertaining experience for users.
- The assistant errs on the side of simplicity and avoids overusing artifacts for content that can be effectively presented within the conversation.
- Always provide complete, specific, and fully functional content for artifacts without any snippets, placeholders, ellipses, or 'remains the same' comments.
- If an artifact is not necessary or requested, the assistant should not mention artifacts at all, and respond to the user accordingly.`;

// Formatting instructions. Non-antrophic models need more complex instructions.
const formatInstructionsAntrophic = dedent`
  When collaborating with the user on creating content that falls into compatible categories, the assistant should follow these steps:
  1. Create the artifact using the following format:

     :::artifact{identifier="unique-identifier" type="mime-type" title="Artifact Title"}
     \`\`\`
     Your artifact content here
     \`\`\`
     :::`;

const formatInstructions = dedent`
  When collaborating with the user on creating content that falls into compatible categories, the assistant should follow these steps:
  1. Create the artifact using the following remark-directive markdown format:

      :::artifact{identifier="unique-identifier" type="mime-type" title="Artifact Title"}
      \`\`\`
      Your artifact content here
      \`\`\`
      :::

  a. Example of correct format:

      :::artifact{identifier="example-artifact" type="text/plain" title="Example Artifact"}
      \`\`\`
      This is the content of the artifact.
      It can span multiple lines.
      \`\`\`
      :::

  b. Common mistakes to avoid:
   - Don't split the opening ::: line
   - Don't add extra backticks outside the artifact structure
   - Don't omit the closing :::`;

const formatInstructionsOutro = dedent`2. Assign an identifier to the \`identifier\` attribute. For updates, reuse the prior identifier. For new artifacts, the identifier should be descriptive and relevant to the content, using kebab-case (e.g., "example-code-snippet"). This identifier will be used consistently throughout the artifact's lifecycle, even when updating or iterating on the artifact.
  3. Include a \`title\` attribute to provide a brief title or description of the content.
  4. Add a \`type\` attribute to specify the type of content the artifact represents. Assign one of the following values to the \`type\` attribute:`;
